You are building a demo-ready Emergency Message Triage & Resource Matching Dashboard for disaster response teams.

Objective

Create a dispatcher-facing decision-support web app that ingests bulk emergency messages, extracts urgency and location, ranks requests, and matches them with nearby verified resources. This is not a public app; it simulates backend triage used by NGOs and control rooms.

Tech Stack (use exactly this)

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express

NLP: OpenAI API (prompt-based JSON extraction)

Maps: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap + Nominatim

Storage: In-memory JSON only (no database)

Core Features (ONLY these 3)

Bulk Message Ingestion

Textarea where multiple emergency messages are pasted (newline-separated)

Button: “Analyze Messages”

Label UI clearly as “Simulated Emergency Message Feed (Dispatcher View)”

NLP-Based Triage & Explainable Urgency Scoring

For each message, extract:

need

quantity (or null)

location (text)

urgency_level (low / medium / high)

urgency_reason (one sentence)

Use OpenAI API with a structured prompt and JSON-only response

Compute an urgency score (0–100) locally using simple rules

Display urgency score + explanation in UI

Resource Matching & Map Visualization

Hardcode 8–10 verified resources (ambulance, shelter, food center) with lat/lng

Match requests to resources based on need type and proximity

Show ranked results in a table

Display request + matched resource on a Leaflet map

Backend Requirements

Single Express endpoint: /analyze

Accept bulk messages as array

Call OpenAI API per message

Parse JSON safely

Compute urgency score and match resources

Return clean structured response to frontend

Include fallback logic if OpenAI fails (basic keyword rules)

NLP Prompt Template

Use this exact structure:

Extract emergency details from the message.
Return ONLY valid JSON with:
- need
- quantity
- location
- urgency_level
- urgency_reason

Message: "{{message}}"

Urgency Scoring Logic

High urgency → base 70

Medium urgency → base 40

Low urgency → base 20

+10 if medical keywords

+10 if children or elderly mentioned

Cap score at 100

Always provide a human-readable explanation

Constraints

No authentication

No database

No test cases

No background jobs

Prioritize clarity, visual polish, and explainability

UI should look like a government/NGO dashboard, not an AI toy
